Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-31 

1. Overview

This privacy policy explains how Remindy ("the App", "we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

We value your privacy and are committed to handling your data responsibly and transparently. This policy describes our practices regarding data collection, usage, storage, and your rights as a user.

2. Information We Collect

(a) Information You Provide

Voice Input: When you use the microphone to talk to the AI assistant, your voice is converted to text using speech recognition services (for example, Apple Speech or Expo Speech Recognition. Depending on your device and operating system, speech recognition may rely on native OS capabilities or Expo’s SpeechRecognition API.). The audio is processed in real-time and only the transcribed text is retained temporarily for processing your request.

Reminders, To-Dos, Medcine Schedules, Special Days and Notes: Text, dates, times, categories, and titles you add manually or through voice input are stored locally on your device. This includes recurring event patterns, notification preferences, and any custom labels or tags you create.

Settings and Preferences: Language, calendar format, week start preferences, date format, notification settings, theme preferences (light/dark mode), and other customization options you configure within the app.

Special Days and Anniversaries: Dates, names, and any notes associated with special events you track in the app, including lunar calendar preferences.

Medication Schedules: If you use the medication reminder feature, times, dosages, medication names, and scheduling information are stored locally.

(b) Automatically Collected Information

Device Information: Such as device model, operating system version, app version number, device language, and screen resolution. This information is used only for debugging purposes and to ensure compatibility across different devices.

Usage Data: Anonymous, aggregated data about how you interact with the app (e.g., which features are used most frequently, session duration, navigation patterns). This helps us understand user behavior and improve the user experience.

Performance Data: Crash reports, error logs, and performance metrics that help us identify and fix bugs and optimize app performance.

(c) Third-Party Services

OpenAI API: When using AI-based features (such as natural language understanding, smart suggestions, or voice command interpretation), anonymized text data may be sent to OpenAI's GPT model via a secure proxy server. We do not send any personally identifiable information, and the data is used solely for processing your immediate request.

Expo / Cloudflare Proxy: Used to ensure secure API communication and to protect your API keys. Our proxy server acts as an intermediary to keep sensitive credentials secure. No personal information is logged or stored by these services.

Speech Recognition Services: Depending on your device, speech-to-text conversion may use Apple's Speech Framework (iOS) or Google's Speech Recognition (Android). These services process audio locally on your device when possible.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data to:

Process Voice Commands: Understand your spoken requests and generate AI-based responses, create reminders, add to-dos, or perform other actions you request through voice input.

Improve App Features: Analyze usage patterns to identify which features are most valuable and where improvements can be made. All analysis is done on aggregated, anonymous data.

Fix Bugs and Issues: Use error reports and crash logs to diagnose and resolve technical problems, ensuring a stable and reliable app experience.

Provide Personalized Suggestions: Generate intelligent recommendations for reminders, recurring events, or task management based on your usage patterns and preferences.

Maintain Proper Functioning: Ensure voice recognition, AI services, notifications, and other core features work correctly and reliably.

Enhance User Experience: Optimize performance, improve interface design, and develop new features based on how users interact with the app.

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. We do not use your data for advertising or tracking across other apps or websites.

4. Data Storage and Retention

Local Storage: Most of your data (reminders, notes, calendar items, to-dos, medication schedules, special days) is stored exclusively on your device using secure local storage mechanisms provided by your operating system.

Temporary AI Processing: Text derived from voice input may be sent to our secure proxy server and then to OpenAI's API for processing. This data is transmitted over encrypted connections and is not permanently stored on our servers or by OpenAI after processing is complete.

Voice Recordings: We do not retain voice recordings. Audio is converted to text in real-time and only the transcribed text is used for immediate processing of your request.

We do not link any collected information to your identity. All processing is either local to your device or performed anonymously through secure servers.

Data Deletion: You can delete all stored data at any time by:
- Uninstalling the app (removes all local data)
- Clearing app data in your device's system settings
- Using in-app deletion features for individual items

Backup and Sync: Currently, the app does not provide cloud backup or sync features. All data remains on your device unless you manually back it up using your device's backup features.

This app does not use tracking technologies or request App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permissions. We do not track users across apps or websites.

5. Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:

Encryption: All network communications are encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols to prevent interception or tampering during transmission.

Secure Storage: Data stored on your device uses the platform's secure storage mechanisms (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android).

API Security: API keys and credentials are stored securely on our server proxy and are never exposed in the client app or transmitted to your device.

Access Controls: Sensitive operations (e.g., speech-to-text and AI calls) are token-protected and require proper authentication.

Regular Updates: We regularly update our security practices and dependencies to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.

Data Minimization: We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide the app's functionality.

While we take reasonable precautions to protect your data, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security but are committed to protecting your information to the best of our ability.

6. Your Rights

Depending on your region (e.g., EU under GDPR, UK under UK GDPR, California under CCPA), you may have the following rights:

Right to Access: Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.

Right to Deletion: Request deletion of your personal data. Since most data is stored locally on your device, you can delete it directly through the app or by uninstalling.

Right to Correction: Update or correct any inaccurate information.

Right to Object: Withdraw consent for speech recognition, AI processing, or other optional features.

Right to Portability: Request your data in a portable format (where applicable).

Right to Lodge a Complaint: Contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns about our privacy practices.

To exercise these rights, please email us at harperchang2025@gmail.com. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by applicable law.

7. Children's Privacy

Our App is not designed for or directed at children under 13 years of age (or the applicable age of digital consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.

8. International Data Transfers

If you use the app outside your country of residence, your data may be transferred to and processed in countries with different data protection laws. When using AI features, data may be processed by servers located in various regions. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. Updates will be reflected by the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. Significant changes will be announced within the App through notifications or in-app messages.

We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.

10. Third-Party Links

The app may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information.
